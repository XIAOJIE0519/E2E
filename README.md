Welcome to an interrrrresting package built by Shanjie Luan. Firstly, if you want to cite, please cite as "Shanjie Luan (2025). E2E: An R Package that makes it easy to ensemble. https://github.com/XIAOJIE0519/E2E"

If you want to use it (This package is still under maintenance, and I do not recommend using it. Of course, if you want to give it a try, I won't stop you.), use
